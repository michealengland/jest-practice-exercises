# [Getting Started](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started)

Following along with this doc, I started by adding the following

1. Created a structured directory for testing
2. Created a function called sum in `sum.js`.
3. Setup a test in `sum.test.js` to verify the expected value of sum.
4. Verified with test with `npm run t`.
